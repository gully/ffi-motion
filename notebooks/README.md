## Contents

### 01- Simulations of driftscan FFIs
  1. Exploratory analysis of FFIs
  2. Subtracting off background
  3. Adding in Poisson noise
  4. Save an mp4 animation, test astrophysical variability
  5. Quantify signal-to-noise ratio from driftscans
  6. Alternate version of S/N ratio restimate

### 02- K2 pixel mask counts across campaigns
  1. How many times has each K2 pixel been telemetered, C13 demo
  2. Inspect the incremental pixel counts
  3. How many times has each pixel been telemetered?
  4. How many times has each K2 pixel been telemetered, faster implementation
  5. FFI counts spot-check with plots of windows over FFIs
  6. K2 double-counting estimate
  7. Stack FFI counts across campaigns to find out the most observed pixels

### 03- Kepler Flat field analysis
  1. Spot-check of a small window of the flat field

### 04- Driftscan FFI analysis
  1. Overview analysis of the actual post-C17 driftscan FFIs
  2. Prototype of source extraction for line traces on star trails
  3. Clean line traces on star trails found with source extraction
